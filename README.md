# SparkR model implementation
The purpose of this repository is to build an example model developed in SparkR.
The case example uses a kaggle repository https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit. All data for the models are stored on this site. In 
addition Random Forest implementation has been taken from one of the solutions. Credit worthiness is predicted in this example. The case sample has been developed in a way that most users of R can access this example relatively easy and use it as a reference, for streamlining the transition from R to SparkR.
